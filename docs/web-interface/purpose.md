# Web Interface: Purpose and Evolution

## Introduction
The initial purpose of our web interface was aimed for a straightforward yet vital objective: **to visually explore and understand the correlation between various features and the real oil price**. Which later was planned to evolve into a more comprehensive platform that supports model predictions and evaluations.

## Initial Purpose: Correlation Exploration
The initial version of our web interface was designed to provide a user-friendly environment where users could select one or more features and observe their correlation with real oil prices. This functionality was crucial for several reasons:

- **Simplifying Complexity**: The relationships between different features and oil prices can be intricate and varied. The web interface sought to simplify these relationships, making them accessible and understandable with  visualizations and interactive controls.

- **Interactive Learning**: By interactively selecting features and observing their correlation with oil prices, users could develop a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing oil prices. This active participation in data exploration fosters a deeper and more engaged learning experience.

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Armed with a better understanding of the data, users can make more informed decisions and predictions. The web interface provides a platform for users to explore the data and gain insights that can be applied to data-driven decision-making.

## Evolution: From Exploration to Prediction and Evaluation
As our project matured and our understanding of machine learning deepened, so too did the capabilities of our web interface. It evolved from a tool for simple data correlation exploration to a comprehensive platform that supports model predictions and evaluations. This transformation was driven by a desire to provide more value and a more holistic experience for our users.

- **Model Integration**: Users can now leverage the power of machine learning models directly from the web interface. This integration allows for real-time predictions, giving users instant insights and forecasts based on the data and models.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Alongside predictions, the web interface provides various evaluation metrics, helping users to assess the accuracy of the models. This feature is crucial for building trust in the predictions and ensuring that users have all the information they need to make informed decisions.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: The evolution of the web interface has been accompanied by improvements in usability and design. The goal was to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform, reducing barriers to entry and ensuring that users of all backgrounds can easily navigate and utilize the tool.

## Conclusion
The web interface stands as a testament to our project's growth and our commitment to providing practical and impactful solutions. What began as a tool for correlation exploration has blossomed into a multifaceted platform, empowering users to not only understand the past and present but also to peer into the future with advanced model predictions.

By continually adapting and expanding the capabilities of our web interface, we strive to provide a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore the intricate world of machine learning, from novices and students to experienced analysts and decision-makers.
