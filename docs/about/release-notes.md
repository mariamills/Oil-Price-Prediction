# Release Notes - The Oval Table


## The Oval Table - Oil Price Prediction Models
### Version: v1.0

#### Cycle 1 (08/24/2023 - 10/08/2023) Summary:

##### Introduction to ML:

- First venture into the realm of Machine Learning.

- Laid the groundwork with Regression models to predict oil prices.

- Models Introduced:
    - **XGBoost**: Utilized a gradient boosting framework with decision trees.

    - **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method utilizing multiple decision trees.

    - **Polynomial Regression**: A regression algorithm modeling the relationship between input and output as an nth degree polynomial.

    - **Baseline Model**: Introduced a **Naive Forecast** as a basic comparison tool.

##### Challenges & Learnings:

- **Overfitting**: Identified that models were prone to overfitting on the training data.

##### Next Steps: 

- Implement model refinement to address overfitting issues.
- Integrate time series forecasting to predict future oil prices.
- Web interface integration.

#### Cycle 2 (10/09/2023 - Present) Updates:

##### Shift in Focus:
 
- Transitioned the core focus towards Time Series models, as per the wants and requirements of our 'client', (a professor at CSU).

- A priority has been set on enhancing oil price prediction accuracy using Time Series methods.

##### Time Series Models:
- Delving into Time Series models to cater to the specific needs of oil price forecasting.

- Research and development are in progress to refine these models and improve their predictive capabilities.

##### Model Refinement Plans:

- While Time Series remains the primary focus, there's an **underlying aim to address the overfitting issues from Cycle 1**.

- Depending on the progress and time constraints, there might be further refinements made to the regression models from the previous cycle.

##### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

- Recognized the need for more meticulous data cleaning.

- Plans are set to further refine preprocessing steps, if the semester's timeline allows.
